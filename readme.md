## Alexandria Democratic Committee Results Screen

This code was used to display local city election races during the 2018 Midterm Elections in Alexandria, Virginia.  There are two main folders for this project: /citycouncil and /ussenate.  Even though they work similar, they handle differently the total display and order of each election result.  You can modify these files depending on the particular race and structure you may want to use.

## Required fields 
You will need the JSON URL from the Virginia State Board of Elections.  You will be able to find that under https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/election-results/

Please note that this code is offered as is.  The Virginia Department of Elections may modify database schemas that might break this code.
